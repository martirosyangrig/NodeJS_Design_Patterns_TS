The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

So if our class requires a lot of params when reading code we should check every time which params 
does our class requires it makes a little not commfortable so we create a builder class 
and using chaining we pass the params through functions 

That makes code more readable and understandable.
