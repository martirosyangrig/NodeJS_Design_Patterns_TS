The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm or strategy at runtime from a family of algorithms. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the context that uses it, providing a way to encapsulate interchangeable behaviors within a class hierarchy.

So we have LogStrategy which gives us varios algorithms
 
We can use one change to another algorith use that and again change
