Prototype patterns says that we can always create an instance from our class giving default params 
and from that instance we can clone new instances so we wont need every time to give default values 
when createing an instance;

In scout.prototype.ts file you can see we re creating an instance and giving default params to it;
and using clone method we re creating new instances from it;

OFC we can impliment this using other technic but here I showed you how to impliment Prototype based;
